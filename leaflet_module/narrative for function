Now, I'm generating a list of all the photo names and converting it to a dataframe. I'm going to match against this list. The folder he gave me contains non-photos too, but I think they will be filtered out by the join.


I'm going to remove all duplicate names for now.


Use an antijoin to filter out everything that doesn't match.


Okay, this seems to be fully unique names.

The photo name format contains the fullname, but then might include additional description, such as:

```{r}
photo_df$photo_names[12]
```

So I'm going to have to a fuzzy/ partial match. So using "Appleton Richard" will correctly match with that photo. The problem is that the fuzzy match might also incorrect match people with similar names.

So, I need to match to the most complete name first, and then the least complete name.

```{r}


```

Seeing what photos weren't matched. I'm actually going to move them somewhere else for the second round of matching. (I don't know that I need to move them. I may just be able to make a new photo list.)

At a quick glance, this looks to be correct.

Now I don't want to move the unmatched files. I want to move the matched files.

```{r}
# not_matched_first_round <- anti_join(photo_df, tombstones_merged)
# 
# index <- 1
# for (index in seq(1:nrow(not_matched_first_round))) {
#   file.rename(from = here(blog_folder, photo_folder,  not_matched_first_round$photo_names[index]),
#                          to = here(blog_folder, problem_folder, not_matched_first_round$photo_names[index] ))
# }
# 

```

```{r}


```

Get an error even though it looks like it moved some files. The error is

```         
Jones Levi A Jones Hester J.JPG
```

which is one tombstone for both. This will kick up errors everywhere.

I'm dropping all the NAs in the photo_names column.

```{r}

#deleting NAs


```
Look at these high multiples more closely.

Now I need to redo everything so it will only match on the panel figures and not the ones I moved.



```{r}

```

I think this produces one more than it should in photo names. 75 instead of 74 via code below vs looking at \# files in the folders. probably still this shared name hester & levi jones

```         
sum(!is.na(tombstones_matched$photo_names2))
